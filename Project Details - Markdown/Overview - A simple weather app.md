## Project requirements:
1. Public Weather API Integration: [[API Details]]
2. State Management: Manage and display dynamic data such as temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts using React state.
3. User Interface (UI): Design an attractive, responsive, user-friendly user interface to display weather information. Include icons and charts.
4. Routing: Implement routing to allow users to search for weather in different locations or view extended forecasts.
5. Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, such as when the API request fails or the location is not found/invalid.
6. User Experience: Focus on providing a smooth and intuitive user experience, possibly incorporation geolocation for initial automatic location detection
7. Testing: Practice writing tests for the components and functions to ensure the app's reliability.
8. Deployment: Deploy the weather app through Firebase's free hosting services.
9. Optimization: Learn how to use concepts such as lazy loading, code splitting, and reducing unnecessary API requests.

## Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to gain valuable hands-on experience developing React applications on a practical project that can be used in my daily life.
My goals are to learn further frontend development, testing, API integration, more about state management, and React routing.
