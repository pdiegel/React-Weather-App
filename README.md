# React-Weather-App

## Description

React-Weather-App is an engaging web application that provides real-time weather information. It automatically detects the user's current geographical coordinates via the browser to display relevant weather updates. The app also offers a search functionality for users to find weather details for any location in the United States. Utilizing the National Weather Service (NWS) API for weather data and the Geocode API from maps.co for location coordinates, it provides both current weather conditions and a weekly forecast.
